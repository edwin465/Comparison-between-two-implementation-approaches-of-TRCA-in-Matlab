# Comparison-between-two-implementation-approaches-of-TRCA-in-Matlab
Recently, the task-related component analysis (TRCA) is widely used in the SSVEP recognition.  Here I compare two implementation approaches of TRCA in Matlab. One is proposed by Masaki Nakanishi in https://github.com/mnakanishi/TRCA-SSVEP/tree/master/src. Based on this version, I propose a new version which has a shorter calculation time.
